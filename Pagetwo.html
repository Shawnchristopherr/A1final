    <h1>Personal Profile</h1>

    <h4>Result of online Myers-Briggs test: <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/intj-personality">The Assertive Architect - INTJ-A</a></h4>
    <p>The INTJ personality type is defined as analytical problem-solver, innovative, intellectual and introverted.
    <br>INTJ’s prefer to work alone in careers that are mentally stimulating, indulging in the challenge.
    <br>This is the third rarest personality type on the planet, having only 2% of the population falling under this category. 
    <br>Famous INTJ personality types include Bill Gates, Stephen Hawking, Elon Musk and Sir Isaac Newton.</p>
    
    <h4>Result of online learning style test: <a href="http://www.educationplanner.org/students/self-assessments/learning-styles-quiz.shtml?event=results&A=1&V=12&T=7">Visual Learner</a></h4>
    Auditory: 5%, Visual: 60%, Tactile: 35%
    <pre>“If you are a visual learner, you learn by reading or seeing pictures.
    You understand and remember things by sight.
    You can picture what you are learning in your head, and you learn best by using methods that are primarily visual.
    You like to see what you are learning.
    As a visual learner, you are usually neat and clean.
    You often close your eyes to visualize or remember something, and you will find something to watch if you become bored. 
    You may have difficulty with spoken directions and may be easily distracted by sounds.
    You are attracted to colour and to spoken language (like stories) that is rich in imagery” - educationplanner.org</pre>
    
    <h4>Results of Big Five Personality Test:</h4>
    
    <h4 style="color:Tomato;">Openness 81%</h4>
        <ul>
        <li>“High scorers tend to be creative, adventurous, and intellectual. Low scorers tend to be practical, conventional and focused on the concrete.” - Truity.com</li></ul>
        
    <h4 style="color:Tomato;">Conscientiousness 60%</h4>
        <ul>
        <li>“High scorers are organized and determined and are able to forego immediate gratification for the sake of long-term achievement. Low scorers are impulsive and easily sidetracked.” - Truity.com</li></ul>
        
    <h4 style="color:Tomato;">Extraversion 29%</h4>
        <ul>
        <li> “Extraversion seems to be related to the emotional payoff that a person gets from achieving a goal. While everyone experiences victories in life, it seems that extroverts are especially thrilled by these victories, especially when they earn the attention of others. Getting a promotion, finding a new romance, or winning an award are all likely to bring an extrovert great joy. In contrast, introverts do not experience as much of a “high” from social achievements. They tend to be more content with simple, quiet lives, and rarely seek attention from others.” - Truity.com</li></ul>
        
    <h4 style="color:Tomato;">Agreeableness 56%</h4>
        <ul>
        <li> “People who are high in Agreeableness experience a great deal of empathy and tend to get pleasure out of serving and taking care of others. They are usually trusting and forgiving.
    People who are low in Agreeableness tend to experience less empathy and put their own concerns ahead of others. Low scorers are often described as hostile, competitive, and antagonistic. They tend to have more conflictual relationships and often fall out with people.” - Truity.com</li></ul>
    
    <h4 style="color:Tomato;">Neuroticism 21%</h4>
        <ul>
        <li>“High Neuroticism scorers are more likely to react to a situation with fear, anger, sadness, and the like. Low Neuroticism scorers are more likely to brush off their misfortune and move on.” - Truity.com</li></ul>
    
    <h4>What do these results mean for me?</h4>
    The one thing that I noticed immediately after taking the Myers-Briggs test is that a decent amount of it is hit and miss.
    <br>Although it indeed shared insights into some aspects of my personality, it also got a lot of it wrong.
    <br>This leads me to believe that even though this is a highly respected and widely used test often relied on by potential employers to sort through candidates, that without pinpoint 100% accuracy the test itself is left with some flaws, and one singularity in this regard by right makes the entirety of the test invalid to be used as scientific evidence, because if one part is not true, what is to say the rest of it is. 
    <br>Humans are simply much more complex and far too different from one another than to be categorized into subcategories based on the result of a few questions taking the timeframe of mere minutes.
    <br>I think it would be more beneficial to take these results as something to take into consideration when dealing with certain situations where this insight may prove useful, using it as a guide rather than taking it as law.
    <br>With the results from the learning type tests, I believe this one to be the most accurate of the three. 
    <br>From past experiences I know that visual learning is where I can concentrate and pick things up quickly, having built several complex things just from the likes of watching YouTube videos and such.  
    
    
    <h4>How do I think these results may influence my behaviour in a team?</h4>
    The result from the testing shows that when working with a team, I will get the most benefit when learning and co-operating through visual means, making use of things like webcam calling and screenshare.  
    <br>Also, the results suggest that being an INTJ (Architect), I can be a little reclused as I prone to introversion. 
    <br>This can be remedied by ensuring team communication and participation is actively scheduled and maintained, cementing it into my daily routine, while making consistent efforts to actively ensue the team is all on the same page and each person has their tasks laid out clear to them.  

    <h4>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h4>
    When forming a team, it would be vital to try to ensure the rest of my team members all have the same goal and strive to be active and participate actively. 
    <br>INTJ’s are not overly tolerant of people that do not pick things up as quickly as they do, so putting in steps to make this problem does not surface would be effective. 
    <br>I also believe getting to know your team during the initial stages will help with communication, as getting to know teammates beyond that of a professional acquaintance will help communication and team-work flow more effortlessly.
