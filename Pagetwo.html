    As a visual learner, you are usually neat and clean.
    You often close your eyes to visualize or remember something, and you will find something to watch if you become bored. 
    You may have difficulty with spoken directions and may be easily distracted by sounds.
    You are attracted to colour and to spoken language (like stories) that is rich in imagery” - educationplanner.org</pre>
    
    <h4>Results of Big Five Personality Test:</h4>
    
    <h4 style="color:Tomato;">Openness 81%</h4>
        <ul>
        <li>“High scorers tend to be creative, adventurous, and intellectual. Low scorers tend to be practical, conventional and focused on the concrete.” - Truity.com</li></ul>
        
    <h4 style="color:Tomato;">Conscientiousness 60%</h4>
        <ul>
        <li>“High scorers are organized and determined and are able to forego immediate gratification for the sake of long-term achievement. Low scorers are impulsive and easily sidetracked.” - Truity.com</li></ul>
        
    <h4 style="color:Tomato;">Extraversion 29%</h4>
        <ul>
        <li> “Extraversion seems to be related to the emotional payoff that a person gets from achieving a goal. While everyone experiences victories in life, it seems that extroverts are especially thrilled by these victories, especially when they earn the attention of others. Getting a promotion, finding a new romance, or winning an award are all likely to bring an extrovert great joy. In contrast, introverts do not experience as much of a “high” from social achievements. They tend to be more content with simple, quiet lives, and rarely seek attention from others.” - Truity.com</li></ul>
        
    <h4 style="color:Tomato;">Agreeableness 56%</h4>
        <ul>
        <li> “People who are high in Agreeableness experience a great deal of empathy and tend to get pleasure out of serving and taking care of others. They are usually trusting and forgiving.
    People who are low in Agreeableness tend to experience less empathy and put their own concerns ahead of others. Low scorers are often described as hostile, competitive, and antagonistic. They tend to have more conflictual relationships and often fall out with people.” - Truity.com</li></ul>
    
    <h4 style="color:Tomato;">Neuroticism 21%</h4>
        <ul>
        <li>“High Neuroticism scorers are more likely to react to a situation with fear, anger, sadness, and the like. Low Neuroticism scorers are more likely to brush off their misfortune and move on.” - Truity.com</li></ul>
    
    <h4>What do these results mean for me?</h4>
    The INTJ-A personality type result is interesting, especially when compared with the big five personality test. The results seem to point in accordance with each other, sharing insight into my personality from a logical standpoint I have not thought about yet.
    <br>Though naturally, I take these categorisations with a grain of salt, it is fascinating to see how well some of the results for these tests resonate with my personality now.
    <br>I believe the key points of the INJT-A to be highly accurate, being Introverted, Innovative, Thinking and Judging. I am a deeply analytical thinker, more often than not using logic to make informed decisions instead of feelings. The introversion trait is also true, often preferring to spend time alone than with others. 
    
    
    <h4>How do I think these results may influence my behaviour in a team?</h4>
    The INTJ personality type is depicted as being deeply analytical thinkers, often seeing outside the box when it comes to problem-solving, and using innovative thinking to create new ideas to overcome and obstacles. This trait can be a valuable part of working within a team, as this will enable the team to have solutions that would not normally be clear to the other personality types.
    <br>INTJ’s are also introverted and prefer to work in solitude, this may influence my behaviour in a team by being semi-recluded, and not inclined to contribute for the sake of making friendships, instead only doing so to achieve results.
    
    <h4>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h4>
    When forming a team, it would be important to keep in mind that communication is a clear part of teamwork, yet too much can exhausting. Keeping conversation focused on the task at hand and avoiding unnecessary small talk is encouraged.
    <br>It is also vital for me to recognise if or when I am being reclusive, and to make the effort to communicate more with fellow team members when need be.
