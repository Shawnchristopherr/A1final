        <h3><p style="text-align: center;">Shawn Mills ( S3916603 / s3916603@student.rmit.edu.au )
        RMIT Bachelor of Information Technology student.</p></h3>
        
        <h4>About me:</h4>
        
        <p>I’m 26  years old and I live in the beautiful tropics of North Queensland. 
        I completed year 11 in 2010 with elective subjects in IT.
        <br>My working background consists of Hospitality, Sales, Mining and Logistics, with the latter being what I'm currently employed in now.</br> 
        My various hobbies include building computers, photography, drones and gaming.
        <br>Fun fact about me: I can recite every single line in the movie "Fast and furious: Tokyo Drift", without even looking at the screen. (This has annoyed countless friends, sorry not sorry)</br></p>

        <h3>My interest in Information Technology</h3>
        <p>I’ve always been interested in the world and the evolution of tech.
        <br>From the innovation of the first portable phones that transcended into the smartphones we have today, millions of times more powerful than the Apollo 11 guidance computers that helped put man on the moon in 1969; to the evolution of the gaming console, something that I witnessed as a young boy playing my Nintendo and original PlayStation thinking that the graphics were absolutely out of this world; to today with latest GPUs and consoles, with the ability to display actual realistic-lifelike graphics that blow anything from my younger days completely out of the water.
        I am always finding myself reading tech news, watching tech reviews on YouTube, online shopping for all the latest and greatest tech and, you guessed it, buying it (at the demise of my wallet). 
        <br>If I were to relate this to a movie quote, It would have to be from the movie The Fast and the Furious, where Jesse says:<p style="color:MediumSeaGreen;"> “There’s just something about <s>engines</s> computers that calms me down, you know?”.</p>
        
        <p>If I were to pinpoint a time which my interest started, I would say it was around the age of 10. A family friend had recently gotten into the hobby of building computers for himself and others, and through which I got gifted a tower of my own, which I ended up pulling apart and putting back together just to see if I could, numerous times.
        <br>Lately, my interests have been between:<br>
        Building my dream computer, which I successfully completed late last year and tinkering with it so that I can do to it to truly make it unique and perform as best as it can through overclocking different parts and,
        Mechanical keyboards, a niche hobby that I’ve recently discovered, where I’ve completely built a one of a kind custom mechanical keyboard to look and feel exactly how I want, and am now absolutely hooked on the hobby.</p>
        
        <h3>Why did I choose to come to RMIT?</h3>
        
        <p>I needed a university that was able to offer the flexibility to study the whole course completely online. As I live and work full time, physically going to uni was not an option. Also, I needed to find an entryway into University that catered for mature aged students, as I left school before the completion of year 12 and do not have an ATAR score. RMIT was able to cater to all these specific requirements through Open Universities Australia.</p>
        
        After doing some research into RMIT itself, I discovered that it was a world leader in my specific field (Information Technology) which helped cement my decision to enrol with the university, and as a bonus, the university resides in Melbourne, which is where I am planning to move to in about a years time, and I will have the option to take advantage of the universities facilities if I wish.
        
        <h3>What do I expect to learn during my studies?</h3>
        <p>Throughout the course of my bachelor's degree, I expect to learn the skills that will enable me to be employed as a competent IT professional. 
        <br>These skills will include programming and software engineering with also skills engineered on how to effectively work and communicate within a professional team environment.</p> 
        
        <h3>My Ideal Job: <a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/52497509?type=standout#searchRequestToken=bcf8a97d-56a1-4ddf-9f8b-77c999234860">Lead Cyber Security Analyst</a> </h3>
        
        <p>This position is that of a Lead Cyber Security Analyst.
        <br>A lead cyber security analyst is an individual tasked with leading a team responsible for the client’s IT infrastructure. This includes round-the-clock monitoring, detection, triaging and analysis of security alerts, detection and prevention of intrusions, vulnerability testing with reporting on appropriate mitigations and so on.
        <br>There are a few reasons why this position is appealing to me.
        <br>Firstly, this is a job that is in high demand and will continue to become even more so as the world continually shifts to going completely online, and with it, more cybercriminals. As more and more data joins the internet the more the security of it becomes vital in order to protect people from those that would cause harm.
        <br>Secondly, it’s fun, interesting and rewarding work.
        <br>You will never feel like you’re doing archaic, unnecessary work. In a world where threats and technology are ever-evolving, so too does its defence need to be. 
        <br>There is great satisfaction in doing work that requires you to be on your toes, keeping your mind constantly engaged, and even better that doing so directly helps protects peoples livelihoods.</p>
        
        <h4>Skills, qualifications and experience required for this position:</h4>
        Strong technical predilection, knowledge and propensity for continuous autonomous learning and development in security technology controls, proxy, IDS/IPS, DDOS, SIEM, Cyber Threat Intelligence, Threat hunting and incident response.

        <h4>My plan for obtaining the skills, qualifications and experience required for this position:</h4>
        Step one: Complete my degree in Information Technology. Not only is this a requirement for the job, but it will also be the basis of my knowledge to gain a career in this field. The degree will help me gain knowledge in the IT industry while also gaining relevant skills to work as an IT professional.
        <br>Step two: Acquire relevant security industry-relevant qualifications. These will act as proof that I will be able to do the job as required. This step can also be done throughout the course of my degree.
        <br>Step three: After completion of my degree, I will ascertain a job as a cybersecurity analyst. 
        This will give me relevant industry experience in the cybersecurity field while simultaneously gaining further knowledge about the role in itself. I will maintain the role of cybersecurity analyst until I am confident that I can advance to Lead Cybersecurity Analyst.
        <br>Step four: Land a job as a Lead Cyber Security Analyst. Plan complete!
