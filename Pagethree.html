    <h1>IT project idea:</h1>
<p>A global shipping tracker app for android specifically designed for Australian users.
<br>This will be referred to as Project 1 from here on. My project idea stems from something that I am passionate about (being online shopping, as I’m always on the hunt for the latest and greatest tech) and wanting an Innovation to make tracking packages significantly more streamlined. </p>

<h4>Overview:</h4>
Project 1 will be designed to work for Android.
<br>The app will enable the user to conveniently see the tracking status and the tracking history of current deliveries from the main Australian couriers (and also a select number of the main postal companies from around the world) without having to use the courier specific tracking apps, or having to consistently check their emails, find the email containing that specific tracking link and clicking on it to be taken to another site to display the tracking status.

<h4>Motivation:</h4>
As a passionate online shopping addict, I am always constantly checking my individual apps and also emails (which is a massive pain) to find out the status of my expected deliveries.
<br>This app will take away the hassle of doing so and will essentially make tracking shipments an effortless task, streamlining the whole process.
<br>With Australia having the 11th largest e-commerce market in the world and a revenue predicted to reach USD 32.3 billion by 2024 with year by year increase of 15.5%, there is a very substantial market for this kind of service. 

<h4>Description:</h4>
The app codenamed Project 1 will be an app designed to work with the Android operating system.
<br>Project 1 will feature the ability to track multiple shipments from numerous postal services/couriers from Australia and around the world in real-time and display them on one singular home screen.<br>

<br>Features will include:
	<ul>
    <li>Security:<br>Users will be able to lock the app with either a password, pin or pattern. This ensures that not everyone will be able to track their shipments if they were to just pick up their phone.</li><br>
    <li>Accounts:<br> Users will be able to create an account have their shipments synced with their account. This will allow users that use multiple phones or devices (like a tablet) the ability to track shipments from an array of devices. </li><br>
    <li>Web browser / Email integration:<br> Users will be able to click the tracking link sent to them and the option to open the link with Project 1 will pop up on their phone, prompting the user if they would like Project 1 to track this shipment. This can be triggered so that this is done automatically.</li><br>
    <li>Home page:<br> This will be the main screen of the app which will be the automatic screen users will see after opening the app and logging in. This page will provide an overview of their currently tracked shipments and the last shipping update for each shipment. The last shipping update will include the last known location so users do not have to click into each shipment to view their whereabouts. This allows users to simply open the app and get all the relevant information about their expected deliveries all from the one home screen.<br>Other features of the home page will be an add shipment button, enabling users to add a shipment by pasting a tracking number into the pop-up box when prompted.</li><br>
    <li>A detailed page for each shipment:<br> this page will be accessible by clicking the respective shipment the user wants further information on on the home page.<br>This page will feature the tracking history and other details, viewed as individual updates by order of newest to last, as specified by each shipping couriers tracking service. It will also include a global map with the last know location of the shipment pinned to it. This allows the user to visually see where the last know location is.<br>Users will also be able to see the current ETA for each shipment, with the address being hidden for security purposes.</li><br>
    <li>Integration for all the main Australian postal services tracking. This includes Australia Post, FedEx, DHL, Startrack, Fastway, Toll, Couriers Please and TNT.</li><br>
    <li>Widget for home and lock screens:<br> The widget will give a brief overview of current shipments giving users the ability to see a selection of shipments based on what is coming first.</li><br>
    <li>Possibility for global integration: <br>The app could be further developed so that other frequently used postal services by Australian shoppers that shop internationally can be integrated with the app as well. This will allow the user to track shipments with other couriers overseas that haven’t entered into Australia yet and generated a local tracking number. This feature will be extremely convenient as the user will have the ability to track a shipment no matter its location worldwide.</li><br>
    <li>Push notifications:<br>This feature enables the app to send a push notification to your phone whenever a shipment gets a tracking update.</li></ul>
    
    
    
<h4>Potential Drawbacks:</h4>
As this app relies on compatibility from other already established tracking services (in order to use their data and services) and their companies, a failure in this would lead to the app not being fully functional. 

<h4>Tools and Technologies that will be required from my understanding:</h4>
Software required:
<br><a href="https://developer.android.com/studio">Android Studio:</a> An open-source Gradle based build system with a feature-rich emulator and unified environment that enables the development for all android devices. Comes with GitHub integration to help build common app features and import sample code.

<p>Hardware required:<br>Each user of the app will require a smartphone running the Android Operating System. For building the app, the development environment can be run on a computer running any OS (Mac, Windows or Linux).</p>

<h4>Skills required:</h4>
	<ol>
    <li>Designing skills. This will ensure the app flows nicely while maintaining an attractive and professional look.</li>
    <li>Writing skills. This ensures the app has no grammatical errors and has a clean professional appeal.</li>
    <li>QA and Performance Testing skills. Essential for the continued stability of the app.</li>
    <li>Data skills: In an app that’s all about information and how to display it as conveniently and smoothly as possible, experienced data engineers will be required in order to build the required databases and repositories.</li></ol>
    
<h4>Outcome:</h4>
If the project is successful, users will no longer have to check different apps and emails in order to find specific tracking details for their shipments, instead they will be able to see the statuses just from their home screen (if using a widget) or the home page on the app. This outcome allows for its users to get more time back into their day, leaving more time for family, work, and leisure.
